                like what do you even do with it, ;-;
                argh. time to look at some ol' projex of mine.
                oooonnn secooond thoooooought, BAD IDEA.
                do it normally.
                ditch engine.
                that makes hades look like a vacation.

                found on gh
                installed node/npm
                ran `npm install -g browserify` [shouldn't need to do this again]
                ran `npm install pathfinding`
                created main.js

            physix
                took weeks to make proper progress
                still don't know how or why it works.
                but it does.
                basic collisions implemented
                player bounces off blocks.
        sep. 6
            bullets
                done, i think. basic, basic implementation.
            gun
                this is new, o.O
            effects
                idk why these won't work, o.O
                stupid me, xD
                forgot to set specs.size in arguments 
                    for constructor
            enemies
                whee
        sep. 7
            enemies
                yep. puttin' a halt on this for now.
                hopefully, come back to it later today.
            physix
                why does it get stuck at these weird angles, o.O?
                yuck. i hate the patch 'cuz it doesn't solve
                    squat, but hey, it works.
        sep. 8
            enemies
                back at it.
                noooope xDDD
            physix
                so i haven't solved the problem, ;-;
                screw bouncy :joy:
                it works just fine, o.o huhh?!?!?!?
            enemies
                we at it again bois
                so i got pathfindin' to work-ish
                    need to prove that the arrays are the same
        sep. 11
            pathfindin' is awful. i hate this.

        nov. 20
            gettin' back to it
            so i have some ideas.
            they aren't good ideas.
            but like, ideas lol.
            so, what if movement is based on a vector.
            vector or <mag, ang> rather than <x, y>
            ik. ik. that isn't conventional.
            but like, it might solve my problem?
            would need to weight dodgin' less than pf.
            then convert vector to <x, y> an' done.
            wonder if that could be a sick game idea.
            mouse or spacebar only.
            only control mag an' angle.
            like mini putt.
            but like a platformer.
            top-down platformer lol.
            idk the mechanics of that.
            would it be a sine wave velocity?
            or like just a constant acc?
            idk not important lol.
            
            dodgin'
                weight based on (threshold - dist) / threshold
            aimin'
            
            need to rethink the tier system.
            take some ideas from Argon's Escape 2?
                
            changed speed, reload, an' damage of bullets
            player should not be faster than the bullets lol

        jul. 9 - jul. 10 morn
            it's been nearly a yr.
            let's get into it.

            patched ski.js to work w chrome 118+
            adjusted src att of script tags to match ski.js dir change
            fixed circle-rect collisions for player by forcin' velocity to be zero against a block
            added raymarchin' func
            used raymarchin' to determine if pathfindin' is necessary instead of line-rect collisions w every block (hopefully faster for larger maps)
            fixed bullet-enemy collisions to use two circle-circle collide calls instead of one circle-line call
            fixed small pathfindin' issue
            made enemies a child of npc class
            predictive aimin' for npc (FIRST TRY)
            added acceleration to enemy movement (SECOND TRY)
            enemies now stop at certain distance from player given that there's nothin' between them an' the player (snipers r gon' be wild)
            moved to developin' in vs code
            yay, it's responsive. workin' on fullscreen in vsc live server
            oh an' added a google font + init function
        jul. 10
            gave up on dodgin', i don't think it could possibly work w smooth movement
            the enemy will just be mad aggressive w the shootin'
            okay so maybe they do need to learn how to dodge, or smth w their movement, it might be too fast-paced atm an' robotic (ykwim)
            enemies now found players based on a weighted system for distance an' health
            enemies now handle targets better
            did some housekeepin'
            restructured the whole project so that it flows better
            added entity class (first time doin' this) which includes player & npcs
            fixed camera to move to next living entity after player dies
            added system to only allow one-on-one enemy lock-on
            well, i said i couldn't do real-time pathfindin'
            that it was impossible.
            i just did.
            GET OUT OF HERE. I'M THE GOOOOAAATTTTTTTTTT.
            WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
            ggs kids. u'll never get to this level
            okayyyy, this game is insanely hard.
            like next-to-impossible to beat
        jul. 11
            added mini-map, whee
            so bullet-block collisions r wonky, need to fix those
            then bullet-ally collisions
            i think i discovered that the cpu is smarter than most players
            so i just looked it up an' level design theory exists
            time to implement that
            planned out the rest of the project. this release is goin' to go crazy.
        jul. 12
            workin' on some more updates.
            added breakable blocks an' round animation + magazine clip/reload.
            time to work on collisions.
